# Fake_News_Detection
Python and Machine Learning project to detect if the news article is Fake or Real.

Terminologies used in the project:

Fake News: Fake news is false or misleading information presented as news.

TfidfVectorizer:
TF (Term Frequency): The number of times a word appears in a document is its Term Frequency.
IDF (Inverse Document Frequency): Words that occur many times a document, but also occur many times in many others, may be irrelevant. 
  IDF is a measure of how significant a term is in the entire corpus.
  
PassiveAggressiveClassifier: Passive Aggressive algorithms remains passive for a correct classification outcome, 
  and turns aggressive in the event of a miscalculation, updating and adjusting.
  
Scikit-learn: Is probably the most useful library for machine learning in Python. 
  The sklearn library contains a lot of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling.
  
NumPy: Is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. NumPy arrays facilitate advanced mathematical and 
  other types of operations on large numbers of data.
  
Pandas: DataFrame is two-dimensional size-mutable, potentially heterogeneous tabular data structure with labeled axes (rows and columns).
  Indexing and Selecting Data. Working with Missing Data. Iterating over rows and columns.
  
Classification: Refers to a predictive modeling problem where a class label is predicted for a given example of input data.

Stopwords: Are the English words which does not add much meaning to a sentence. They can safely be ignored without sacrificing the meaning of the sentence.

Confusion matrix: Is a tabular summary of the number of correct and incorrect predictions made by a classifier.
  It can be used to evaluate the performance of a classification model.
